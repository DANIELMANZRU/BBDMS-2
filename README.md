This system have function use to keep the donation record of the donor. Besides, the process of adding data, delete data, update the data can be done anywhere by using mobile phone.
The majority of blood banks still conduct their business using manual techniques. As a result, there is inefficiency because data collection for blood donors, blood bag inventories, and transfusion services is still done on paper. Patients' health may be in jeopardy if there is improper recordkeeping since contaminated blood bags could be used.

Therefore, a blood bank application may be required to handle these challenges and other concerns that arise to guarantee the safety of blood transfusions.
